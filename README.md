# ToDo List Application

## Overview
This is a simple ToDo List application built with SwiftUI. The application allows you to manage your daily tasks effectively. You can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Quickly add a new task with a simple touch.
- **Swipe to Delete**: Easily delete tasks by swiping them to the right.

## How It Works

### Adding a New Task
To add a new task, tap the rotating "plus" button at the top right corner of the application. A new task titled "New Task" will appear in the list. You can then tap on the task to rename it.

### Deleting a Task
To delete a task, you have two options:
1. **Swipe-to-Delete**: Swipe the task to the right to reveal the "Delete" button. Tap it to delete the task.
2. **Edit Mode**: Tap the "Edit" button on the top left corner to enable Edit mode. Select multiple tasks and tap "Delete".

### Marking Tasks as Completed
To mark a task as completed, simply tap the circle next to the task name. A checkmark will appear, indicating the task has been completed. You'll also feel a small haptic feedback.

### Editing a Task
To edit the name of a task, tap on the text of the task. An inline text editor will appear allowing you to rename the task.
